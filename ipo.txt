This is a program that generates Math Flash Cards! It takes all 4 operators (+, -, *, /). It generates 2 random numbers depending on the level the user chooses (easy, medium, hard) and takes them and uses them in the operator they chose. If they get it right, they are greeted with a message telling them they were correct, if they were wrong, it tells them what the correct answer the program was looking for. At the end, they can choose whether to restart or exit.
